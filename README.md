# Hacktoberfest 2019 - CodeVu
Get started with the open-source world and win swag for your contributions from DigitalOcean and DEV.

## Introduction
This web app is a crowd-sourced comprehensive list and implementation of common coding problems as well as data structures & algorithms. The app considers the files in the `problems` and `DSA` folders to generate the content for the website. 

## About Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is a month-long event where you, as a beginner to the open-source world, contribute to projects. Open-source is a great place to learn how to build software, see veteran developers in action, and see your own code in action on a global platform. Hacktoberfest seeks to help beginners dive into the world of open-source by making 4 simple pull requests (for 2019) and receiving a T-shirt as well as stickers on their successful completion.

Note that as of 2019, Hacktoberfest DOES NOT consider census repositories valid - that is, repos where you just add your name and profile as a pull request are no longer valid to participate in Hacktoberfest.

## Getting Started

### Registration
Register for Hacktoberfest [here at DigitalOcean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). 
<!-- ### Finding a Repository
Look for repositories to contribute to. One easy way is to search for the label `hacktoberfest` on GitHub to find beginner-friendly repositories. This particular repository is one of them. -->
### Making your contribution

1. Fork and star this repository
2. Create and switch to a new branch for your edit with the command `git checkout -b 'your-branch-name'`
3. Add your code
4. Save and commit your changes with `git commit -m "Message describing what you did"`
5. Push your code with `git push origin 'your-branch-name'`
6. Visit your fork of the repository and make a pull request
7. Wait and see your changes becoming live

## Contributing
### Contribute to the code 
You are expected to either come up with the code to the problems in the `problems` folder AND/OR add your code for your own Data Structures and Algorithms problem in the `DSA` folder.

Here are some rules to be followed:
1. Make sure your code actually works
2. Format and indent your code properly
3. Maintain the directory structure
4. Use exactly one PR for exactly one problem/data structure/algorithm
5. Document your code along with the expected space- and time-complexities 
#### Directory structure
For problems:
`<problems>/<name_of_problem>/<language>/<file>`

For data structures:
`<DSA>/<data_structures>/<name_of_ds>/<language>/<file>`

For algorithms:
`<DSA>/<algorithms>/<name_of_algo>/<language>/<file>`
#### Languages
You are free to use any language you want as long as you follow the above rules and maintain the spirit of contributing to open-source development.
